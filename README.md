# MindAtlas_Course_Report_PHP

This is a PHP version of the course report.

## Yang(Author)'s comment:

To get this running, you need to:

1. Prepare a MYSQL database using the scripts provided: codetest2.sql 

(please remember to change database credentials in config.php so that the program can login into your local database)


2. run index.php


3. Visit the page via http://localhost/

My PHP version: 7.4.29
